The data came from a survey run by Kaggle in 2020. The survey was open for approximately one month and collected over 20,000 responses. In addition to collecting more basic information such as compensation, job title and size of the company, the survey includes data on the type of technology used by the professionals and their companies. In total, the survey included 39 features, most of which were categorical. This includes the target variable, salary, which was submitted in bins containing ranges of salary in USD.
